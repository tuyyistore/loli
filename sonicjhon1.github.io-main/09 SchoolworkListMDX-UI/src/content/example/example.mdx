## Notable thing today
Today, I set up and configured an inventory-management system called **[InvenTree](https://inventree.org/)** for my shop. Its quite nice for tracking stocks, price, and cost. But I think it needs a better frontend before it could be used as a POS machine. I then decided to play around with Obsidian again! I customized the theme, installed **Style Settings** plugin, and configured the **AnuPuccin** to my liking. Here is how it looks like right now:

and I also updated [Home](D%202023-01-30)'s banner to use Genshin Impacts wallpapers from [Genshin.Global](https://genshin.global/download-official-wallpapers/):
<div style="width: 50%">
![Genshin](https://genshin.global/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/nahida-dendro-3-2-official-desktop-genshin-wallpaper.jpg)
</div>

After that, I decided to rename the Attachments in the assets folder that hadn't been renamed yet. Then, I moved all of the Attachments to a new **Attachments** folder inside of Assets and changed the default obsidian attachment folder.

I noticed that [my website](https://sonicj.pages.dev) is currently broken, I plan to fix it tomorrow and start working on [PW09 2023-01-30](D%202023-01-30).

Later this afternoon I added 2 CSS snippets to this vault: **【Tool】MInimal Circle Images.css** and **align.css**. Minimal Circle adds circle images by the #round prefix. Align adds alignment to markdown by adding class="left|center|right" to a span. I also added emojis to the folder's name. This makes my Obsidian looks like this:
